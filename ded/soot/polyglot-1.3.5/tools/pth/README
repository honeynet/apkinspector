		      Pth: Polyglot Test Harness
		      --------------------------

Pth is a small tool to assist automated regression testing of Polyglot
extensions. pth is given as input a test script, which lists test
programs and the expected result of compiling them with the Polyglot
extension.

Using Pth
---------
When configuring the Polyglot distribution, the executable script
$POLYGLOT/bin/pth is created. This script should be used to execute
pth. The command line option "-h" will provide a summary of the
command line options available for pth.

Pth Test Scripts
----------------
An example test script can be found in the JL extension test
directory: $POLYGLOT/src/polyglot/ext/jl/tests/pthScript.

The following BNF grammar describes the structure of pth test
scripts. Comments may be included anywhere in test scripts; Java-style
comments ("/*...*/" and "// ...") and lines beginning with a pound
sign ('#') are treated as comments.


  ScriptFile   ::= CompilerTest+
  CompilerTest ::= ExtClassName ["CmdLineArgs"] { FileTest [; FileTest]* }
  FileTest     ::= Filenames [Description] [FailureSet]
  Filenames    ::= Filename [Filename]*
  Description  ::= LitString
  FailureSet   ::= Failure [, Failure]*
  Failure      ::= ( ErrorKind )
                |  ( ErrorKind, "RegExp" )
                |  ( "RegExp" )
                |  ( )
  ErrorKind    :   one of, or a unique prefix of one of the following 
                   strings: "Warning", "Internal Error", "I/O Error", 
                   "Lexical Error", "Syntax Error", "Semantic Error"
                   or "Post-compiler Error".
  Filename     :   the name of a file. Is interpreted from the 
                   directory where pth is run.
  LitString    :   a literal string, enclosed in quotes.
  RegExp       :   a regular expression, as in java.util.regex; 
                   is always enclosed in quotes.
  CmdLineArgs  :   additional command line args for the Polyglot 
                   compiler; is always enclosed in quotes.



For example, the following is a valid test script, and illustrates
common usage of the test script files.

	    polyglot.ext.jl.ExtensionInfo {
		 // this is a test that is meant to succeed
		 SuccessfulTest1.jl ; 

		 // another succesful test, with a description
		 SuccessfulTest2.jl "test array initialization" ; 

		 // this test should generate a compiler warning
		 FailTest1.jl ( Warning ) ; 

		 // this test should fail with a semantic error containing 
		 // the substring "might already have been assigned"
		 FailTest2.jl ( Semantic, ".*might already have been assigned.*"); 

		 // this test should fail, genearting both a warning and a
		 // post-compiler error
		 FailTest3.jl ( Warning ), ( Post, ".*finally block.*"); 

		 // this test requires compiling two files at the same time.
		 MutualA.jl MutualB.jl ; 

		 // this test fails with a syntax failure, and the
		 // special expected failure "()" ignores all other failures.
		 FailTest4.jl ( Syntax ), () ; 
	    }
