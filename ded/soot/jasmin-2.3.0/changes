Jasmin Revision History                                 Sable Research Group

May 28, 2004                [Chris Pickett]
    added .no_super directive (for compiling java.lang.Object)

Sept 5, 2003                [Feng Qian]
    fixed various compile shell scripts for SunOS

May 4, 2002 - Release sable-1.1.4 [Feng Qian]
    - fixed jasmin.Scanner to allow an attribute string longer than 65536.  

May 3, 2001 - Release sable-1.1 [Patrick Lam, Feng Qian]
    - No changes except for highjacking the versioning scheme.

Apr 17, 2001 - Release 1.06-s11 [Patrick Lam, Feng Qian]
    - upgraded java_cup from 0.9d to 0.10j (plam); jasmin now
          compiles properly under recent JDKs.
    - adjust code attribute table format, add a table size before 
	  attribute table. Code_attribute will have same head format as
	  LineNumberTable attribute.
    - Correctness patch for emitting constant numbers due to 
          Brian Demsky (bdemsky@mit.edu).

Apr 2, 2001 - Release 1.06-s10  [Feng Qian (fqian@sable.mcgill.ca)]

      reported by jmunsin@abo.fi

Jan 25, 2001 - Release 1.06-s9 [Patrick Lam (plam@sable.mcgill.ca)]
    - Realized that compilation would be a lot simpler if 
        soot.tagkit.Base64 was included in our jasmin distribution;
        copied the file (to the jas library) and added warnings.
    - Minor change to lib/src/scm/driver.java to make it compile with 1.3.0.

May 2, 2000 - Release 1.06-s8 [Patrick Lam (plam@sable.mcgill.ca)]

Changes:
    - Not sure what versions 1.06-s6, -s7 modified.
    - Added support for quoted literal names to fix issues with
            variables named, for instance, "int".
    - Patrice Pominville (patrice@sable.mcgill.ca) added support 
            for incorporation of attributes into bytecode.

March 29, 1999 - Release 1.06-s5  [Raja Vallee-Rai (rvalleerai@sable.mcgill.ca)]

Jasmin Revision History                                     Jonathan Meyer

11 Apr 97 - Release 1.06.

11 Apr 97

   * Fixed bug which prevented the source name from being written out
     in the class file

   * Improved README file

2 Mar 97 - Release 1.05.

1 Mar 97

   * Moved scripts into a bin directory. 

   * Added support for Visual J++.

     Added vjasmin.bat, for running Jasmin using Visual J++.

     Converted JAS/Jasmin to use its own internal RuntimeConstants, so that
     there is no longer any dependency on Sun's version (needed by J++).

   * Tidied API:

     Renamed "Jasmin" class "ClassFile" (sorry to those of you using the API
     from 1.04). The ClassFile class is documented in the doc/api directory.

   * Mods for Java 1.1:

     Classes now set the ACC_SUPER bit in their access flags.
     i2b/i2s/i2c are now synonyms for int2byte, int2short, int2char.
     invokespecial is now a synonym for invokenonvirtual.

   * Mods to pick up documentation in book:
    
     "wide" is now a recognized instruction in Jasmin files - although the assembler
     just ignores it!
 
     Added the optional <high> parameter to tableswitch. 

   * Fixed bug in .catch all
    
10 Feb 96 - Release 1.04.

8 Feb 97
   * Updated to use latest version of JAS. This fixes some bugs in the
     earlier release (including handling of _w instructions)

   * Split several of the internal classes into smaller pieces.

   * Restructured internal sources so that Jasmin, Scanner and parser
     no longer rely on static data structures. Now there is a public API
     to Jasmin, for people that want to assemble classes using their own
     data input/output streams.

30 Oct 96

   * Added support for more \ escapes in quoted strings. In
     particular, you can now use \nnn to specify a character using
     octal.

2 Oct 96 - Release 1.03.

1 Oct 96

   * Added better support for interfaces: added the .interface
     directive (an alternative to the .class directive), and also a
     .implements directive. Updates guide.html to mention these new
     features.

24 Sept 96

   * Fixed several problems with guide.html - thanks to feedback from
     Shawn Silverman (umsilve1@cc.umanitoba.ca).

23 Aug 96

   * Tidied up documentation and implementation for wide instructions.

     Now ldc and ldc_w are used for single-word items, whereas
     ldc2_w is used for two word items (previously, I had ldc_w as
     a synonym for ldc2_w - oops).

25 July 96

   * Added documentation for .var directive.

   * Fixed line numbering produced by -g flag (I hope).

   * Improved error reporting slightly.

24 July 96

   * Added fix to scanner to handle Ctrl-M characters,
     for DOS/NT Systems. (Thanks sbk!)

18 July 96 - Release 1.0.
